# Interrupts-and-Exceptions-Simulator
An extension of the LC-3b simulator that handles interrupts and exceptions

It is equipped to handle one timer interrupt and three types of exceptions: protection, unaligned access, and unknown opcode. It is not equipped to handle nested interrupts/exceptions.

I'm not totally sure whether this ucode text file is the correct one that I used when I completed this project, to be honest.

See README.pdf for more info.
